# Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction

I recently completed a comprehensive project focused on customer churn analysis and prediction. Initially, I performed data analysis to understand the reasons why customers are churning. By examining a dataset that included attributes like demographics, service usage, and billing information, I identified key factors contributing to churn. This analysis involved creating various KPIs and interactive dashboards to visualize customer behavior and pinpoint the attributes most associated with churn.

Building on these insights, I conducted a separate analysis of newly joined customer data to predict how many of these new customers are likely to churn in the future. This analysis included creating interactive dashboards to understand why newly joined customers might churn, providing a detailed view of potential risks and areas for improvement.
